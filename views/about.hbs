    <p>Hey there! My name is Noah Fainer. I am a photographer, videographer and motion designer who specializes in marketing and advertising. I have a passion to create visuals for brands to help them tell their stories. 
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
        I got my post-secondary education at Western University in Media Information and Technoculture as well as Fanshawe College in Interactive Media Design. Iâ€™ve been a content creator for the past 4 years and have been working working as a freelancer, working for Western U HAS Marketing, Western TV, Western Gazette and Productions in the 6ix.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was the Director of Videography for the CAISA fashion show, the largest student run charity fashion show in Canada with our videos reaching collectively over 30,000 views helping raise over $350,000 for the Children Health Foundation and having an event attendance of over 1500 people each year. This work was entirely volunteer based.
