        <p>Bud Light Dreams Festival is an electronic music festival hosted at Echo Beach in Toronto, Canada. This festival brings in an attendace of around 25,000 people over the course of two days each year. I was given the opportunity to work for the festival's production team as a photographer. I got to work with brands such as Monster energy and Coca-Cola taking product shots during the festival. I was also given the task to take photos of various artists through out the festival over both days. Some of the artists I took photo of at Dreams include Oliver Heldens, Ghastly, Duke Dumont, Lights, Zedd and Ryan Shepherd. </p>
