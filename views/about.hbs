    <p>My name is Noah Fainer. I believe that doing more is living more. Itâ€™s hard to say: am I a snowboarder, skateboarder, teacher, photographer or motion graphics artist? The answer to me is simply all the above. However, this is how I see myself. My online identity can be said to be different than my offline because my online identity exists as a result of the actions I take, while my offline identity is constantly being molded by my experiences and surroundings. Furthermore, this is because I curate my online profiles to express who I believe I am and what is most important to me. I have a goal in life and a career to pursue; I want to tell the world that this is who I am trying to be (just not as explicitly).</p>
